Columbus - An A* Integrated Smart Navigation System

Columbus is a program that utilizes an A* algorithm with a primary heuristic of direct distance, a speech recognition engine, pyaudio, and tkinter to enable efficient navigation of Carnegie Mellon University’s Wean Hall. The program offers several features that find the fastest route from the user location to a specific destination, to popular destinations in Wean Hall, to user saved destinations, to the nearest restroom or printer, and to “God.” The program integrates speech recognition and keyword filter analysis to improve the user experience and begin enabling future integrations for the visually-impaired.
